    <p>The <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">rabbit r1</a> is marketed as a pocket companion, powered by rabbit os — a personalized operating system through a natural language interface. Bullshit. The rabbit r1 is a toy for <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">adult children</a> with excess disposable income and a paralyzing fear of missing out on the latest piece of tech; tech they need in order to keep up with the Joneses. Rather than producing innovative tech of merit, they opted to manufacture problems that don’t need to be solved. Rabbit has clearly earned a top spot in this club along with the likes of <a href="https://humane.com/">Humane</a> and <a href="https://teenage.engineering/">teenage engineering</a>.</p>
