<article>
<p>I joined Twitter a few years ago with the intent of just flirting with the experience. I was curious about its user experience design and the range of content it offered. My biggest question was whether or not it could provide any value that would make it sticky. Long story short, I didn’t find any value. Even in the browsing of circles directly related to my own discipline, career, or interests it fell short. What I did find was brute posturing, ignorance masquerading as expertise, toxic positivity, rather unlettered assertions, and — in the case of almighty tech — an exercise in mutual masturbation and LFG tropes.</p>

<p>No thanks. I’ll stick with books and reticence.</p>
