<h3 class="mb-4 font-bold">Professionally speaking</h3>
<p class="mb-4 leading-6">I'm a Graphic Designer turned Product Designer with about 20 years of experience spanning graphic design, product design, user research, and strategy. Much of my work focuses on projects that live at the intersection of design, technology, and systems. I frame my work through the lens of strategic inquiry and multidisciplinary human-centered design.</p>

<h3 class="mb-4 font-bold">My career thus far</h3>
<p class="mb-4 leading-6">I've held positions at Modern Treasury, Okta, Mozilla, and Automattic. I've not only led product design and strategy at these institutions, but also played a significant role in shaping design systems and establishing continuous discovery practices.</p>

<h3 class="mb-4 font-bold">Some standouts</h3>
<dt class="mb-2 leading-6 font-bold">Modern Treasury</dt>
<dd class="mb-4 pl-4 leading-6">I worked with the design team at MT to help design and shape a performant design system that spanned both brand and product. This body of work included usage guidelines for our design system that would empower teams without a product designer to build features without worrying about breaking consistency with other parts of the product.</dd>

<h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 font-bold">Pocket</h3>
<p class="mb-4 pl-4 leading-6">While at Mozilla, I worked on improving the onboarding flow and new user experience for Pocket. Part of this work included iterating towards parity across Web, iOS, and Android platforms. This work was largely influenced by insights gained from a continuous discovery framework I helped established during my first few months on the project.</p>

<h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 font-bold">Automattic</h3>
<p class="mb-4 pl-4 leading-6">I wore many hats while at Automattic, but I spent most of my tenure working on projects for WordPress.com, including — but not limited to — optimizing the signup flow, designing their first design system, redesigning the WordPress.com dashboard, and helping shape Calypso — a JavaScript and API powered WordPress.com.</p>

<h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 font-bold">Readmill</h3>
<p class="mb-4 pl-4 leading-6">Readmill holds a special place. It was my first gig as a product designer out of grad school, and I couldn't have asked for a more talented team to work with or a more driven and design lead product to work on. I led the product design for their iOS and Android apps.</p>

<h3 class="mb-4 font-bold">I value</h3>
<p class="mb-4 leading-6">I operate from a set of values that has evolved over the last two decades, and it will continue to evolve over the next two. There are, however, some standouts that have maintained their shape without much distortion. These values share a professional and personal border.</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-6">So, here they are. I value and respect:</p>
<ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-outside mb-4 pl-6 leading-6">
<li>clarity of thought and the ability to be succinct in its communication</li>
<li>time and space to explore all the edges of an idea</li>
<li>tools that perform their job well and get out of the way</li>
<li>integrity and follow through</li>
<li>favoring reason and logic over emotion</li>
<li>a small typographic footprint</li>
<li>quality over quantity as a measure of value</li>
<li>longevity</li>
<li>a willingness to make hard decisions, have hard conversations, and say the things that need to be said</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mb-4 font-bold">Extracarriculars</h3>
<p class="mb-4 leading-6">Anything on two wheels. I've been an avid road cyclist and motorcyclist for years. I spend much of my free time on two wheels exploring the mountains in and around Chattanooga, TN.</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-6">I've been known to dabble in writing and photography. I consider myself proficient in neither, but I'm getting better and enjoy the learning process.</p>
    
<p class="mb-4 leading-6">Before I started my journey as a designer I was on the path of becoming a professional musician (bass guitar is my instrument). And while I took a hard fork, music still plays a central role in how I process what it means to be of this world. My favorite genres are jazz, jazz fusion, blubop, and funk. Oh, and I do still play. Everyday.</p>

<h3 class="mb-4 font-bold">Right now</h3>
<p class="mb-4 leading-6">I am currently a Staff Product Designer at Vercel — working alongside the incredibly talented...</p>
