    <section class="introduction">
        <p>Sinister Twin is the online moniker of Mads Faraday. Hi! I'm a product designer, which means that I research, design, and build things that live on screens of all sizes. I hope that people interact with these things and find them useful. I've been doing this design thing for close to two decades now, which in my book is a pretty good run.</p>

        <p>My relationship with my chosen profession has been a complicated one — so to speak — and not one that I'm still fond of. Truth be told I've grown weary of the tech space and all the alpha chest beating and posturing that comes with it. As each year passes I find myself squeezing less and less joy out of it; sloughing off more and more of my identity so it can slide into that vc-fueled code-bro abyss. Anywho, that's where I'm at with that. A bit melodramatic innit? *If you're interested, you can read more about this here, here, and here.*</p>

        <p>My close friends would say I'm a bit odd, reticent, reclusive, or layered. I'm okay with all of that; I quite like the characterizations. They're quite accurate if I say so myself.</p>
            
        <p>I love playing music (I'm a bass player) and riding my bike (viva la tour). In another life I would've pursued a professional career in either discipline.</p>
            
        <p>I live alone in the wooded foothills of Southeast Tennessee — somewhere between the Tennessee River and Great Smoky Mountains. I prefer nature over cities; solitude over partnership. I'm the best version of myself when solo, and quite frankly I think partnership is overrated — most of it anyway.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The term philosophy, especially in this context, feels a bit pretentious. So does ideology. How about principles? Even better: guiding principles. That's it. The following are a set of guiding principles that have always steered my work — and the manner in which I approach my work — in the right direction. It's a short list.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Keep the designed experience as close to and as consistent with how it is to be used. In other words, don't overthink or overcomplicate. The former will take care of the latter.</li>
        <li>Don't get carried away with aesthetics. Overindulging on superficial ornament shows naivety and uncertainty.</li>
        <li>Think more. Do less. If you want to produce work of substance that produces value for both the client and the customer, you should make sure you understand the problem. This is deceivingly difficult.</li>
        <li>Fuck trends. Or as Sagmeister so eloquently put it: “Style = fart”. Trends are a dime a dozen and tend to result from base intentions. Put your work above the rest and don't fall for it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Thise Site</h2>
        
<p>I've set up camp in this little corner of the web to provide a space for me to write a bit and hone that craft. I'm not good at it, really, but I hope to improve note by note, essay by essay. I suspect that the writing here will traverse my growing range of cultural and research interests:</p>

<ul>
    <li>social theory</li>
    <li>political discourse</li>
    <li>creator economies</li>
    <li>the role of design</li>
    <li>healthspan</li>
    <li>design research</li>
    <li>the aesthetics of ideas</li>
    <li>jazz and music theory</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a space where I'll be publishing some of the projects I've begun exploring in my studio practice, which is a  combination of both product and graphic design. That work is largely exploratory and conceptual in nature.</p>
