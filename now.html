<p>I love the concept of a <code>/now</code> page, and even more so the frame of <code>/now</code> being more of a mix of what's happening this month versus this very moment. Monthly is a bit more traceable and sustainable. So, with thatâ€¦ I plan on updating this page on a monthly basis.</p>

<h2>August</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I've been heads down on some research and design efforts for Vercel's marketplace; Vercel is my full-time gig by the way</li>
    <li>Traveling to SF for a team offsite and to visit with some old friends I haven't seen in too long.</li>
    <li>Logging lots of time spent doing VO2 efforts in an attempt to increase my FTP</li>
    <li>Gutting my kitchen for an upcoming renovation this Fall</li>
    <li>Prepping my property for some much needed landscaping work this Fall</li>
    <li>Contemplating the sad state of education in the US and the overabundance of evangelical Christians in the US (funny how those two fit together so well)</li>
    <li>Planning a trip to Yosemite this Winter</li>
</ul>
