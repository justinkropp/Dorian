    <p>Writing is an essential part of my process. It helps frame how I understand and approach my work, and the greater context around that work. Writing is understanding.</p>
    <p>I'm driven by curiosity, mixing analog and digital media to shape and develop novel visual expressions across a range of design, product, and AI based systems.</p>
